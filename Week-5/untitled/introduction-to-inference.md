# Introduction to Inference

## Inference and Hypothesis Testing

Now, be sure to watch the following videos explaining the concepts of inference and hypothesis testing, and return here afterward.

1. [Another Introduction to Inference](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics-intro/lecture/GvyX6/another-introduction-to-inference)
2. [Hypothesis Testing (for a mean)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics-intro/lecture/nnn84/hypothesis-testing-for-a-mean)
3. [HT (for the mean) examples](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics-intro/lecture/nKo0b/ht-for-the-mean-examples)

## Inference for Other Estimators

Following up, watch the following videos about inference for other estimators, and decision errors

2. [Decision Errors](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics-intro/lecture/XFpuP/decision-errors)

## Significance

Now, watch the below videos to learn about the difference between significance, confidence level, as well as different types of significance. Return here after you finish.
