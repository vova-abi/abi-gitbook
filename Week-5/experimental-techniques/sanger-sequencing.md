# Sanger Sequencing

**DNA Sequencing** is a way to figure out the order of nucleotides along a strand of DNA. **Sanger sequencing** is based on the process of **DNA replication**. Scientists make copies of DNA strands. Then they observe which nucleotides are added. This way the sequence of nucleotides can be seen.&#x20;
