## Set Up swirl

The swirl teaches you R programming and data science interactively, at your own pace, and right in the R console. We use swirl for practice problems.

To install it, follow the below steps.

#### 1. Open RStudio and type the following into the console.

```
> install.packages("swirl")
```

#### 2. This is the only step that you will repeat every time you want to run swirl. First, you will load the package using the `library()` function. Then you will call the function that starts swirl. Type the following, pressing Enter after each line:

```
> library("swirl")
> swirl()
```
