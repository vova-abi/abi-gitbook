# Data Types

## R Data Types

To get a solid understanding of some of the data types used in R, watch the following videos.

1. [Data Types - R Objects and Attributes](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/lecture/OS8hs/data-types-r-objects-and-attributes)
2. [Data Types - Vectors and Lists](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/lecture/wkAHm/data-types-vectors-and-lists)

We will cover more data types in Week 2. For now, our focus will be completing practice problems.
