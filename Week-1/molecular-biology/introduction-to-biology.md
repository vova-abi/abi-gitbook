## What is Life?

Now that we have defined biology, new, more complex questions arise. What exactly is life, and what does it mean to be alive? To delve deeper into this topic, read [this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/intro-to-biology/what-is-biology/a/what-is-life?modal=1), and come back afterward.

## The Scientific Method

Learning all this information is, of course, fascinating, but at some point, you ask yourself - how do biologists even come up with this knowledge? The answer is: through **the scientific method.**

To internalize the concept of the scientific method, first, watch the video below.

Then, read [this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/intro-to-biology/science-of-biology/a/the-science-of-biology?modal=1) to solidify what you just learned. After that, read about the use of [controlled experiments](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/intro-to-biology/science-of-biology/a/experiments-and-observations?modal=1) in the scientific method.

## Conclusion Quiz

It is important to make sure you understood everything you just learned.
