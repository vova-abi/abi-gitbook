# DNA & RNA

## Introduction

You may be familiar with the terms DNA and RNA, but you may be surprised when you find out more about their characteristics. This chapter focuses on explaining the main concepts of DNA and RNA, as well as how they correlate to other processes.

## Nucleic Acids

To start, read [this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/nucleic-acids/a/nucleic-acids?modal=1) to get acquainted with the main characteristics of nucleic acids, and come back afterward.

Now that you have a better understanding of nucleic acids, DNA, and RNA, broaden your knowledge in these topics by watching the following videos (make sure to watch them fully, as this is one of the most fundamental topics in the course).

Finally, be sure to read [this article about the molecular mechanism of DNA replication](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/dna-as-the-genetic-material/dna-replication/a/molecular-mechanism-of-dna-replication), as well as [this one about the mode of DNA replication](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/dna-as-the-genetic-material/dna-replication/a/mode-of-dna-replication-meselson-stahl-experiment), and return here afterward.
