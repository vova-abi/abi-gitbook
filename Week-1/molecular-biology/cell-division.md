# Cell Division

## The Importance of Studying Cells

Studying cells **helps us understand how organisms function**. Cellular components work together to carry out life functions, which in turn enable organisms to meet their basic needs.

## Cell Structure

It is essential to understand the basic structure of a cell. In order to do that, watch the video below.

It is alright if you do not understand some of the concepts presented here. In the context of the course, you only need to know the basics.

## Cell Division

Since cells make up all living organisms, it is only logical to assume that they have a way to multiply. That is why it is important to know the basic underlying processes of cell division.

Again, do not stress about understanding the different phases of cell division or memorizing their names. In the context of this course, you only need to know the difference between mitosis and meiosis and what the outcomes of each are. However, you are always welcome to conduct your own research and find out more.

Watch the video below.
