# Transcription

## Overview of Transcription

**Transcription** is the first step in gene expression. It involves copying a gene's DNA sequence to make an RNA molecule.

To start, read [this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/transcription-of-dna-into-rna/a/overview-of-transcription), and return here afterward.

## Stages of Transcription

As you just read, transcription is a process comprised of 3 main stages. Read [this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/transcription-of-dna-into-rna/a/stages-of-transcription) to find out more about each stage, and return here afterward.

## Transcription and mRNA Processing

Watch the video below to get familiar with transcription including the role of RNA polymerase, promoters, terminators, introns, and exons.

## Eukaryotic pre-mRNA Processing

To take a closer look at the cap, tail, and splicing modifications that eukaryotic RNA transcripts receive and seeing how they're carried out and why they are important for making sure we get the right protein from our RNA, read [this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/transcription-of-dna-into-rna/a/eukaryotic-pre-mrna-processing), and return here afterward.
