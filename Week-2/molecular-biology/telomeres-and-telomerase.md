# Telomeres and Telomerase

**Telomeres** are the protective DNA-protein complexes found at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. They protect the natural ends of linear chromosomes. **Telomerase** is a specific telomere-terminal transferase necessary for the replication of chromosome ends in single-celled organisms.
