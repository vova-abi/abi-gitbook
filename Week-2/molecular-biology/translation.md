# Translation

## Overview of Translation

During translation, a cell “reads” the information in a messenger RNA (mRNA) and uses it to build a protein. Together with transcription, these are the underlying processes of DNA replication.

First, read [this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/translation-polypeptides/a/translation-overview) to get an overview of translation is, and return here afterward.

## mRNA to Protein Translation

To deep dive into how mRNA is translated into proteins with the help of ribosomes and tRNA, watch the video below.
