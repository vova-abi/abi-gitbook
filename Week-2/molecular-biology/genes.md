## Gene Expression: The Central Dogma

Now that you know the definition of genes, it is important to understand how they provide the DNA instructions for proteins. It happens through a process known as the **central dogma.**

Read [this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/central-dogma-transcription/a/intro-to-gene-expression-central-dogma) on the topic of central dogma and gene expression, and return here afterward.

## The Genetic Code

**The genetic code** is the set of rules used by living cells to translate information encoded within genetic material. More specifically, it links groups of nucleotides in an mRNA to amino acids in a protein.
