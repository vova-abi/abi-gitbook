# Control Structures

Control structures in R allow you to control the flow of an R program and are very similar to the control structures that you might see in other types of programming languages.

## Control Structures in R

To get a hang of control structures, watch the following videos:

1. [Control Structures - Introduction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/lecture/8B52C/control-structures-introduction)
2. [Control Structures - If-else](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/lecture/PDOOA/control-structures-if-else)
3. [Control Structures - For loops](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/lecture/baydC/control-structures-for-loops)
4. [Control Structures - While loops](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/lecture/WWXg6/control-structures-while-loops)
5. [Control Structures - Repeat, Next, Break](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/lecture/4osPq/control-structures-repeat-next-break)
