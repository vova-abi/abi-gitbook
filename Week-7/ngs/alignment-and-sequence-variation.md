# Alignment and Sequence Variation

The bioinformatics workflow for handling and for detecting sequence variations starts with the alignment of reads to the genome, followed by what we call variant calling.

To learn more about this topic, watch the following videos from [the Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/genomic-tools/home/welcome), and return here afterward:
