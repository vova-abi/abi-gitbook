# The Basics

Lastly, we review the basics of statistics and R using [this course from Edx](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+PH525.1x+3T2020/home).

In order to access course material, make sure to create an Edx account (if you do not have one already) and enroll in the course. It's completely free.

## Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a key part of what we do when we analyze data. To learn more about it, read [this article ](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+PH525.1x+3T2020/block-v1:HarvardX+PH525.1x+3T2020+type@sequential+block@1fcee636d04c4e1b8b2e5ef3c1b6a7a8/block-v1:HarvardX+PH525.1x+3T2020+type@vertical+block@c99849faa3df42788715d965068860f0)from the course, and return here afterward.

You can use the buttons on the course page to navigate through the various topics. Alternatively, you can always refer to the links here. Whichever way you feel more comfortable with.

## Histograms

A **histogram** is a graphical representation that organizes a group of data points into user-specified ranges.&#x20;

To learn about plotting histograms in R:

Return here after you finish.

## QQ-Plot

A **Q-Q plot** is a scatterplot created by plotting two sets of quantiles against one another.&#x20;

## Boxplots

Finally, we cover boxplots - a standardized way of displaying the dataset based on a five-number summary: the minimum, the maximum, the sample median, and the first and third quartiles.
