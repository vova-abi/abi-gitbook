# Probabilities In Genetics

## Probability

Probabilities are mathematical measures of likelihood. In other words, theyâ€™re a way of quantifying how likely something is to happen. To find out about the use cases of probabilities in genetics, read [this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/classical-genetics/mendelian--genetics/a/probabilities-in-genetics), and return here afterward.

## Variations on Mendel's Laws

Mendel's laws include extensions, exceptions, and revisions. Learn about them by reading[ this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/classical-genetics/variations-on-mendelian-genetics/a/variations-on-mendels-laws-overview), and return here afterward.

## Multiple Alleles, Incomplete Dominance, And Codominance

Mendel's laws have different outcomes than expected when applied to real-life cases due to many specific factors. To learn about them, read [this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/classical-genetics/variations-on-mendelian-genetics/a/multiple-alleles-incomplete-dominance-and-codominance), and return here afterward.
