# Stages of Translation & Protein Targeting

## Stages of Translation

**Translation** involves “decoding” a messenger RNA (mRNA) and using its information to build a polypeptide, or chain of amino acids, in the process of DNA replication.&#x20;

First, read [this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/translation-polypeptides/a/the-stages-of-translation) that explains the stages of translation in-depth, and return here afterward.&#x20;

## Protein Targeting

Protein targeting involves how molecular labels are used to direct proteins to different parts of the cell (and to the cell exterior).&#x20;

Read [this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/translation-polypeptides/a/protein-targeting-and-traffic) to learn more about protein targeting and its role in the cell's lifecycle, and return here afterward.
