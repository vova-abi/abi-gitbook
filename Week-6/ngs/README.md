# NGS

## What Is NGS?

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a massively parallel sequencing technology that offers ultra-high throughput, scalability, and speed. The technology is used to determine the order of nucleotides in entire genomes or targeted regions of DNA or RNA. NGS has revolutionized the biological sciences, allowing labs to perform a wide variety of applications and study biological systems at a level never before possible. We briefly explored NGS in the [NGS Sequencing page of Experimental Techniques](../../Week-5/experimental-techniques/ngs-sequencing.md).

## Why Should I Learn About NGS?

Today's complex genomics questions demand a depth of information beyond the capacity of traditional DNA sequencing technologies. NGS has filled that gap and becomes an everyday tool to address these questions.

## What Are the Learning Outcomes of This Week?

By the end of week 6, you should:

* Be familiar with some of the basic Unix commands
* Know about sequences and genomic features
* Have fundamental knowledge of FastQC
* Know about sequence recreation
* Have good knowledge of SAMtools I and II
