# Power

**Power** is the probability that a test of significance will detect a deviation from the null hypothesis, should such a deviation exist.

To learn about power in statistics, do the following:

1. Watch [this video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics-intro/lecture/kdnQf/power) from the [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics-intro/home/week/3) explaining the concept of power
2. Watch [this video](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+PH525.1x+3T2020/block-v1:HarvardX+PH525.1x+3T2020+type@sequential+block@997dd497b71c4232a588778f28cf894e/block-v1:HarvardX+PH525.1x+3T2020+type@vertical+block@373747e180134696a4b7bcb9d8b82355) from the [edX course](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+PH525.1x+3T2020/home) explaining how to perform power calculations
