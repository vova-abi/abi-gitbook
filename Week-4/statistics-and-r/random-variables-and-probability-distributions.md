# Random Variables and Probability Distributions

We kickstart the Statistics module of the guide by learning about random variables and probability distribution.

What distinguishes the Statistics module of the guide from other modules is that here, we include materials from different resources, differentiated by levels of difficulty. If you find the material to be too difficult to comprehend, make sure to check out the other resources covering the topic. This way, you will get the most of everything.

## Random Variables: Motivation

Visit the [edX course Statistics and R ](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+PH525.1x+3T2020/home)we had viewed earlier in the guide.&#x20;

Make sure you have an edX account and are enrolled in the course.
