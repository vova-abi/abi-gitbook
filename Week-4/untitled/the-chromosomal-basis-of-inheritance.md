# The Chromosomal Basis of Inheritance

## The Theory

Boveri and Sutton's **chromosome theory of inheritance** states that genes are found at specific locations on chromosomes, and that the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis can explain Mendelâ€™s laws of inheritance. Read [this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/classical-genetics/chromosomal-basis-of-genetics/a/discovery-of-the-chromosomal-basis-of-inheritance) to find out how this theory was formed and proven, and return here afterward.

## Genetic Linkage and Mapping

Because there are far more genes in organisms than there are chromosomes, it is only logical to assume that genes are lined up in a row on chromosomes. Their location affects how they are inherited, and therefore how new organisms are formed. To delve deeper into this topic, read [this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/classical-genetics/chromosomal-basis-of-genetics/a/linkage-mapping), and return here afterward.
